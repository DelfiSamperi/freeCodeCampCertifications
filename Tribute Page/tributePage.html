          <li><strong>1878</strong> - Completed her studies as a primary school teacher at <span>Girls Normal School of Buenos Aires</span>, although she had been teaching without a formal qualification since the age of 14 (something common due to the lack of teachers in rural areas).</li>

          <li><strong>1889</strong> - As soon as she graduated, she joined <span>Hospital San Roque</span>, where she dedicated herself to gynecology and obstetrics, but not surgery, a specialty she was denied due to her gender, despite having the qualifications to practice it.</li>
          <li><strong>1891</strong> - Founding member of <span>Argentinian Medical Association</span>, where she was elected president on 1907.</li>
          <li><strong>1892</strong> - Founded the <span>Argentinian Society of First Aid</span>, which later merged with the <span>Argentinian Red Cross</span>. She also pioneered the idea of opening First Aid Rooms in various towns to assist with primary care for the sick.</li>
          <li><strong>1892</strong> - Collaborated with the team led by Samuel Molina in performing the first cesarean section in Argentina at what was then the <span>Women’s Hospital</span>, now <span>Hospital Rivadavia.</span></li>
          <li><strong>1901</strong> - Founder of the <span>National Obstetrics Association and the Obstetrics Journal</span>, which she conceived as a tool to offer Argentinian midwives a scientific and medical approach to the profession.</li>
          <li><strong>1904 - 1905</strong> - Taught the first courses on "Medical Gymnastics and Kinesiotherapy" at the <span>Faculty of Medicine</span>, marking the first steps in the development of kinesiology in Argentina.
